# Chatbot for Screenwriting Q&A

## Introduction
This project implements a chatbot in Python that helps users practice answering questions related to screenwriting. It uses **spaCy** for natural language processing (NLP) and **googletrans** for language translation, enabling the chatbot to evaluate user responses against pre-defined correct answers.

The goal is to create an interactive experience where users can practice answering questions about screenplay preparation, visualization, writing approaches, and other aspects of screenwriting. The chatbot evaluates the similarity between user responses and correct answers and provides feedback.

## Features
- Random selection of screenwriting-related questions.
- Comparison of user input with pre-defined correct answers.
- Feedback based on the similarity between the user's answer and the correct answer.
- Integration of **spaCy** and **Google Translate** for NLP and language translation.
